# EfficientNet-for-Arrhythmia-Classification
Using Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning for High - Accuracy Arrhythmia Classification

This repository contains the implementation of 13-class and 17-class arrhythmia classification models using 2D ECG heartbeat images. 
We apply transfer learning and fine-tuning on the EfficientNet-B7 architecture to perform high-accuracy multi-class classification of arrhythmias.

🚀 Highlights
✅ Transfer learning with pretrained EfficientNet-B7

🧠 Fine-tuning for domain-specific performance

🔢 Supports both 13-class and 17-class classification

📊 Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score,Classification Report and Confusion Matrix

🚀 Highlights
✅ Transfer learning with pretrained EfficientNet-B0

🧠 Fine-tuning 118 layers for domain-specific performance

🔢 Supports 12-class classification
