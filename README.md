# EfficientNet-for-Arrhythmia-Classification
Using Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning for High - Accuracy Arrhythmia Classification

This repository contains the implementation of 12-class, 13-class and 17-class arrhythmia classification models using 2D ECG heartbeat images. 
We apply transfer learning and fine-tuning on the EfficientNet-B7 architecture to perform high-accuracy multi-class classification of arrhythmias.

ðŸš€ Highlights
âœ… Transfer learning with pretrained EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet dataset

ðŸ§  Fine-tuning for domain-specific performance

ðŸ”¢ Supports 12-class, 13-class and 17-class classification

ðŸ“Š Evaluated with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score,Classification Report and Confusion Matrix

ðŸ§  Fine-tuning 118 layers for domain-specific performance for 12-class classifier
